# pinsha

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of pinsha is to provide an easy way to pin the actions in your github
workflows. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of pinsha like so:

``` r
pak::pak("zkamvar/pinsha")
```

## Example

This will take a github action string and replace the floating tag with an SHA
so that you can harden the security of your github actions.

```{r pin_action}
pin_action("r-lib/actions/check-r-package@v2")
pin_action("JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4.7.3")
```

To update all of the actions in your workflows, you can use the `pin()` command
from the root of your repository.

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
pinsha::pin()
```
